					<h3>My Story</h3>

					<aside class="notes">
						Like a lot of people, I started with WordPress by using it to create a simple, personal blog. I had years of web development experience, but had never used WordPress before. When I built my first WordPress blog, I found a theme I liked on the WordPress.org repository. I didn't feel like my blog really needed categories, so I didn't use them. But then all my posts had a "Filed under: Uncategorized" line at the bottom. It seemed silly. Since I knew PHP, I decided to go in and remove that line from the template. But there was a problem: I was afraid whoever wrote the theme would discover it and get mad at me.

						(No one is going to get mad at you if you modify a theme, although there better ways to do it than others.)

						Later, my career took a turn—as careers often do—and I found myself starting to develop WordPress sites professionally. I went to my first WordCamp (WordCamp Mid-Atlantic) and learned more about WordPress in one day than I had the previous six months.

						Later on, I joined a meetup group and started learning from the incredible community I didn't even realize was around me.

						After awhile, I felt like I had enough confidence to share some things I had been learning along the way. I had recently finished my first client responsive design project, and I was doing even more WordPress custom theme development. In the process, I thought of ways to combine the two. So I approached Andy Nacin and said I wanted to speak at a meetup. It went well.

						<p><em>No one</em>, not you, me, or even Rami Abraham, knows <em>everything</em> about <em>anything</em>.</p>

						<p>It's okay to not have the answer to every question. Use it as a springboard for further learning.</p>

						<p>Aim to teach everyone in your audience at least <em>one</em> thing that they didn't know before.</p>
